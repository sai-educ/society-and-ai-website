          <h3>Beyond the Hype: How AI Actually Transforms Teacher Workload and Professional Practice</h3>

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We study AI with society at the center—combining interdisciplinary research, systems thinking, 
          and open practice to understand how emerging technologies reshape learning, work, and culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aim is to convey practical knowledge that advances dignity, equity, and human flourishing.

        <h2>Where We Start: Aligning AI Innovation with UN SDG 4</h2>
        <p>
          Our research is anchored in SDG 4: Quality Education—a blueprint for addressing interlinked 
          challenges in equity, learning quality, teacher capacity, and lifelong learning. We develop 
          open-access research models, finite-state systems, and pedagogical resources that explore how 
          AI can be contextualized, critiqued, and co-designed to advance educational and socially just 
          outcomes across diverse regions and communities.

          <div class="focus-area">
            <h3>Future-Forward Literacies</h3>
            <p>
              We equip learners and educators with the habits and tools to thrive amid accelerating 
              capability: promptcraft and meta-reasoning, AI-augmented writing, and data sensemaking 
              with model skepticism—alongside privacy hygiene, accessibility-first design, and 
              multilingual workflows.

            <h3>Societal and Cultural Formations of AI in Education</h3>
            <p>
              We examine how narratives, norms, and power shape what AI means in classrooms—authorship 
              and assessment, teacher agency, language inclusion, and local trust—across regions and 
              resource settings.

            <h3>Education and Public Awareness</h3>
            <p>
              We turn complex, technical findings into clear, accessible guidance for families, students, 
              and educators—plain-language model/system cards, consent and disclosure practices, 
              academic-integrity frames, and media-literacy tools.

        <h2>Purpose of Society & AI</h2>
        <p>
          The Society & AI Lab exists to explore how AI can be bent—ethically and methodologically—toward 
          solving concrete, interlinked challenges: poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, education 
          access, and public health. We aim to move AI beyond hype toward measurable, localized, and 
          sustainable impact—from rural schools and urban classrooms to community learning centers and 
          public policy labs.
